This is a basic OOP project that made skaters objects and skateboards.
The main focus is training composition like the skater class has skateboard object in it 
And training making methods inside a class and use them in main class.
I choose package-private access beacause I only want to see objects' methods inside this package

Example Output:

Denis planB 8.25 Independent 149 spitfire 53 bonesReds
Denis breakBoard
Denis buyBoard Vitosha 8.25
Adi baker 8.5 Independent 159 spitfire 56 bonesReds
Adi breakBoard
Ceci element 8.25 Independet 139 spitfire 54 element
